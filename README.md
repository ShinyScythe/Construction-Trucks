# Construction-Trucks

An environment developed for my son who loves construction trucks. Plans to implement online capability are currently in the **research and development** phase so my son, and nephew can operate trucks on the same server. 

## Things to fix:
- Set items in bucket to match physics so scooping is functional
- Add more vehicles to simulate a full workzone
- shaders for blocks to reduce load on CPU
- Adding big UI text for toddler comprehension

MOVEMENT:

W - FORWARD

S - BACK

A - ROTATE LEFT

D - ROTATE RIGHT

SPACEBAR - DIG ANIMATION

R - RESET SCENE

ESC - QUIT APPLICATION
